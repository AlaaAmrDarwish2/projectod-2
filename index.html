                Consumer Research
                Caffeine: Consumer Consumption Habits and Safety Perceptions
            </p>
            <!-- <img class="image" src="caff1.png"> -->
            <p class="caption"> Caffeine is well-entrenched in the lives of most Americans. Whether it’s drinking a cup
                of joe in the morning, turning
                to a soda or tea for an afternoon pick-me-up, or indulging in coffee ice cream or tiramisu to end the
                day,
                caffeine-containing products have become an integral part of our daily food choices. But exactly what
                types of
                caffeinated products are Americans choosing, and what are people’s reasons for consuming caffeine in the
                first place?
                What do Americans know about caffeine safety and the amount of caffeine in various products, and what
                are their labeling
                preferences? This survey aimed to find out.</p>

                A New Focus on Sustainability

            <!-- <img class="image" src="caff2.png"> -->
            <p class="caption">Earlier during the COVID pandemic, many of us faced significant changes in our routines
                to access mainstay products we
                keep in our kitchens and prepare meals. As we saw food supply levels and variety be impacted by the
                pandemic, we also
                witnessed food system workers be influenced as well. Many companies went out of business or could not
                safely host
                workers on farms or in processing facilities. Several of these elements are linked to both environmental
                and social
                sustainability aspects of our food supply—where and how our food is grown, who readies our food for
                purchasing and when
                will it be able to reach consumers were all greatly impacted.</p>
